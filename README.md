## Purpose

The goals of this project are:
1. To create an environment in which paths in configuration spaces of R^3 can be visualized and interacted with. 
2. To visualize the Vietoris-Rips and Cech simplicial complex constructions from elements of Conf_n(R^3).
3. To visualize how such paths produce persistent homology modules.

## Spring 2019 MCL project weekly assignments

*Week of January 28:*
1. Read Chapters III.1 and III.2 in Edelsrbunner and Here's "Computational Topology." [Link here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220692408_Computational_Topology_An_Introduction)
2. Go to the MCL and:
⋅⋅a. Log into the computer with the Oculus attached (by the door)
⋅⋅b. Open Unity, creating an account if necessary
⋅⋅c. Download this repository using `git pull` through the "Git Bash" program on the Desktop
⋅⋅d. Open the project in Unity, start the scene, and add / remove / move points with the Oculus hand controls.
