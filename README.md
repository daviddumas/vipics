## Purpose

The goals of this project are:
1. To create an environment in which paths in configuration spaces of R^3 can be visualized and interacted with. 
2. To visualize the Vietoris-Rips and Cech simplicial complex constructions from elements of Conf_n(R^3).
3. To visualize how such paths produce persistent homology modules.

## Spring 2019 MCL project

This will be where all the information will be kept about the project.
